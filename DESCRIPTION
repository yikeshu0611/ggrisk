Description: The risk plot may be the most commonly used figure in the analysis 
    of tumor genetic data. We can conclude the following two points: Comparing 
    the prediction results of the model with the real survival situation to see 
    whether the survival rate of the high-risk group is lower than that of the 
    low-level group, and whether the survival time of the high-risk group is 
    shorter than that of the low-risk group. The other is to compare the heat 
    map and scatter plot to see the correlation between the predictors and the 
    outcome.
